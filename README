DESCRIPTION:
Ramscanner tool - collects information about a process using: 
/proc/PID/maps
/proc/PID/smaps
/proc/PID/pagemap
/proc/kpagecount
/proc/kpageflags

USAGE:
ramscanner [PIDs]
As arguments, the first PID it receives will be stopped, interrogated using the proc files, then signalled to continue.
All other PIDs received will also be stopped, and used to calculate Gss (see below), then signalled to continue.

Prints summary of information for the process
Vss: Amount of memory addressed in memory map
Rss: Amount of memory memory-mapped in RAM
Pss: Amount of memory per page divided by number of times mapped
Uss: Amount of memory unique to the process (only mapped once)
Sss: Amount of memory only mapped within the process
Gss: Amount of memory only mapped by the processes specified as arguments to this program
Referenced: Amount of memory in pages referenced
Swap: Amount of memory mapped to a swap file/partition
